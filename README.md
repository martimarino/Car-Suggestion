# Car Suggestion

This repo is composed by two parts:
- the feasibility study of an intelligent system able to suggest the best car to a buyer given some preferences expressed.
- an application able to simulate a car driving experience through a GUI and VUI that recognise the emotions of the user and give a final score.
